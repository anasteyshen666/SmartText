# SmartText
This is my first library for Java. In this library you can return count of words or sentenses in the text, and you can return string without whitespaces and array only with words. 
This Library was created like open source project, if you want, you can fix or update my library and posted on your account, but in the list of creators you need write "Created by Anasteyshen666"
